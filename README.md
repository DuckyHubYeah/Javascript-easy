For the project Time and Date 
Here is what i understand about it,

<!DOCTYPE html>
makes the project a html file.

<html>   
<body>    
the html starts my html project and the body makes the text appper

<h2>My First Javascript Project</h2>
The h2 makes heading two selected for the text inside, place in a slash at the end before h2 to end the sequence

onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">
this sets the date and time for the next thing 

Click me to display Date and Time.</button>
the button (with the id element) makes the button and the id element makes the date correct
Then it has a bit of ending code, which makes it ready! have fun
